IDCN Talent Management Platform is a collection of R scripts that wrangle and visualize an IDCN chapter's local membership database.

There are two main features in IDCN TMP:
- Monthly Report, which provides various counts and charts of active and inactive members.
- Targeted Demographics Project, which plots desired job placement outcomes of active members.

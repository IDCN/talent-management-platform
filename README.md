IDCN Talent Management Platform is a collection of R scripts that wrangle and visualize an IDCN chapter's local membership database.

There are two main features in IDCN TMP:
- Monthly Report, which provides various counts and charts of active and inactive members.
- Targeted Demographics Project, which plots desired job placement outcomes of active members.

## More about PyTorch

In more detail, IDCN TMP consists of the following scripts:

| Script | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| **MonthlyReport.R** | a Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU support |
| **TDP.R** | a tape-based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations in torch |
| **torch.nn** | a neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility |
